There are several common deep learning tasks for time series data:

1. **Time Series Forecasting**: This task involves predicting future values of a time series based on historical data. Deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), or gated recurrent units (GRUs) are commonly used for this purpose.

2. **Anomaly Detection**: Deep learning models can be used to detect anomalies or outliers in time series data. These anomalies may represent unusual behavior or events that deviate significantly from normal patterns. Autoencoder-based models or deep learning-based outlier detection algorithms are often used for this task.

3. **Time Series Classification**: In this task, the goal is to classify time series data into different categories or classes based on their patterns. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be used for time series classification tasks.

4. **Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction**: In some cases, the task involves predicting a sequence of future values rather than just a single value. Sequence-to-sequence models, such as encoder-decoder architectures with attention mechanisms, are commonly used for this task.

5. **Time Series Imputation**: Missing data imputation in time series can be addressed using deep learning models. Models like LSTMs or GRUs can learn to impute missing values based on the temporal patterns present in the data.

6. **Time Series Generation**: Generating synthetic time series data that follows similar patterns to the original data is another task. Generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used for generating realistic time series data.

7. **Time Series Segmentation**: Segmenting time series data into meaningful segments or clusters based on similarities in patterns is another task. Unsupervised deep learning techniques like clustering or self-organizing maps (SOMs) can be used for time series segmentation.

These are just some of the common deep learning tasks for time series data, and there may be other specific tasks depending on the application domain. Each task may require different architectures, loss functions, and training strategies tailored to the specific requirements of the problem.
